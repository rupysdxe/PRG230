    <p>Paracetamol is used to treat mild to moderate pain and to reduce fever. It is commonly used for headaches, muscle aches, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds, and fevers. Paracetamol works by blocking the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain and inflammation. It is generally safe when used as directed, but overdosing can lead to severe liver damage.</p>
    <p>Always consult your healthcare provider before taking paracetamol, especially if you have liver conditions or consume alcohol regularly. Do not exceed the recommended dose and follow the instructions provided by your physician or the product label.</p>
