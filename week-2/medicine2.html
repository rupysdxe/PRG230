    <p>Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to reduce fever and treat pain or inflammation caused by many conditions such as headache, toothache, back pain, arthritis, menstrual cramps, or minor injury. It works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body.</p>
    <p>Long-term use of ibuprofen may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding or kidney damage. It is important to take ibuprofen with food or milk to reduce the risk of stomach upset. Do not take more than the recommended dose and consult your healthcare provider if you have any preexisting conditions or are taking other medications.</p>
