    <p>Metformin is an oral diabetes medicine that helps control blood sugar levels. It is used to improve blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes. Metformin works by decreasing glucose production in the liver and improving the body's sensitivity to insulin.</p>
    <p>Metformin should be taken with meals to reduce stomach or bowel side effects. It is important to follow your diet, medication, and exercise routines very closely. Regular blood sugar testing is crucial to ensure the effectiveness of the treatment. Inform your healthcare provider if you experience any side effects or unusual symptoms.</p>
