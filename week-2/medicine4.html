    <p>Aspirin is used to reduce pain, fever, or inflammation. It is also used to treat or prevent heart attacks, strokes, and chest pain (angina). Aspirin is classified as a salicylate and works by reducing substances in the body that cause pain, fever, and inflammation.</p>
    <p>Regular low-dose aspirin is often prescribed to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes. However, aspirin should be used with caution as it can cause gastrointestinal bleeding and other side effects. Consult your healthcare provider before starting aspirin therapy, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p>
